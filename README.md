# README

This tool helps your team to bond over lunches.

It groups your team into groups between 3 and 5.

There is currently no authentication.

You can currently add, edit, or remove team members, and view a page that lists
the random groupings of teammates.

Refreshing the group list generates a new random list of groupings.

Potential new features:

- authentication
- teams organized under one company account
- widgets to display nearby lunch places
- persistent groupings that can be shared with a unique URL
